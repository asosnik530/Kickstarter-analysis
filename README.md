# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Provide insight on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
-I performed my analysis by using a pivot table to to show the number of Theatre campaigns that failed, succeeded or were cancelled based on the month they launched. You can see the pivot table in the tab 'Outcomes based on Lanch date', [Kickstarter_Challenge-Copy](users/asosn/desktop/classwork/crowdfunding&analysis/Kickstarter_Challenge-Copy.xlsx). I then created a chart to summarize the total outcomes for theatre campaigns each month. ![Theatres_Ouctomes_vs_Launch](/Resources/Theatres_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 
-I also performed an analysis creating a table to show the number of plays that failed, succeeded or cancelled play campaigns based on goal amount. In the tab 'Outcomes Based on Goals' you can see the percententage of plays that were successful, failed or cancelled for each tier of goal amounts. In the chart below, you can see a summary of the number of plays that failed, succeeded or were cancelled per goal amount. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
	
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: 
-I did not have any challenges, but one challenge that could take place is how you would like to group the dates either by day, month, quarter or year? Additionally, how do you want to tier the campaign goals? Lastly, you may have difficulty using several Countif statements in a formula. 

## Results

- May and June had the most campaigns, but were the two months with the most successful campaigns. December had a relatively equal amount of succesful and failed campaigns.

- Campaigns with a goal of less than 1,000 were the most successful. Campaigns with goals between $45,000 and $49,999 had a fail rate of 100%. Based on the analysis, the lower the campaign goal the more successful the campaign. 

- Limitations on the datatset include that it did not provide information regarding how each kickstarted obtained their donations. 

- Other analysis that can be perfomed include, calculating how long each goal took from date created to date ended. You could show the number of successful, cancelled and failed campagins based on length of campaign. You could also create a table providing the percentage of failed, succeeded and cancelled campagins compared to the total campaigns held each month. Lastly, you could provide an analysis of the number of failed, succeeded and cancelled campagins based on year instead of month.
