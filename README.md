# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Provide insight on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
	-I performed my analysis by using a pivot table to to show the number of failed, successful and cancelled campagins each month. [Kickstarter_Challenge](C:\Users\asosn\Desktop\Classwork\Crowdfunding analysis\Kickstarter_challenge.xlxs). I then created a chart to summarize the outcomes by month. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](C:\Users\asosn\Desktop\Classwork\Crowdfunding analysis\Resources\Outcomes_vs_Goals.png).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 
	-I also performed an analysis creating a table and using countifs to show the number of failed, successful and cancelled campaigns based on the goals. [Kickstarter_Challenge}(C:\Users\asosn\Desktop\Classwork\Crowdfunding analysis\Kickstarter_challenge.xlxs) I grouped the goals into tiers of 5,000. I used a chart to summarize the number of outcomes per each tier. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](C:\Users\asosn\Desktop\Classwork\Crowdfunding analysis\Resources\Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: 
	-I did not have any challenges, but one challenge that could take place is how you would like to group the dates either by day, month, quarter or year? Additionally, how do you want to group the campaign goals?

## Results

- May and June had the most campaigns, but were the two months with the most successful campaigns. December had a relatively equal amount of succesful and failed campaigns.

- Campaigns with a goal of less than 1,000 were the most successful. Campaigns with goals between $45,000 and $49,999 had a fail rate of 100%. Based on the analysis, the lower the campaign goal the more successful the campaign. 

- The dataset does not provide information regarding how each kickstarted obtained their donations. Also the data does not include how much they received per campagin, only the average donation and the outcome. 

- You could also calculate how long each goal took from date created to date ended, and show the number of successful, cancelled and failed campagins based on length of campaign.You could create a graph to show the percentage of failed, successful and cancelled campaigns per month. You could also create a table providing the percentage of each outcome per total campagin each month.
